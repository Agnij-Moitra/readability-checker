# readability-checker
This is Readability, a python desktop app that will find the appropriate reeading level of a file eg: 8 grade, 9th grade etc.
In your terminal first ensure you are in the correct directory and python and pip are installed.

Then run the following to install the requied modules if you are using MacOS or any distribution of Linux:

```
./requirements.sh
```

If you are on Windows run:

```
.\requirements.bat
```

And then to run the actual App run in the same terminal (All though you can the absolute path of python instead of `python` ):

```
python main.py
```

# Note:
- This will find the readability level of a file on the basis of grammar used. And **NOT** on the basis of scientific dificulty for instance.
